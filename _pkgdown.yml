- title: Filters
  desc: >
    Filters are the bread and butter of ggfx, and thankfully it has a lot. If
    something is missing there is always `with_custom()` to let your creativety
    go wild.

- title: References
  desc: >
    Filters sometimes need to work with multiple layers. This can be achieved by
    turning a layer into a reference, either directly through the filter, or by
    using one of the refefence creators.
  contents:
  - starts_with('as_')
- title: Channels
  desc: >
    Some filters use layers as variable argument input - e.g. the amount of blur
    at each pixel in `with_variable_blur()` is determined by another layer. In
    these instances only a single channel is needed, which can be selected with
    a `ch_*()` selector. If none is given the luminance is used.

- title: Raster placement
  desc: >
    Instead of using a layer as input, one can use a raster object. Since the
    dimensions of the object does not necessarily fit the dimension of the
    rendered plot it is necessary to specify how the raster should be placed and
    resized.
  contents:
  - starts_with('ras_')
- title: Helpers
  desc: >
    For ultimate power over the rendering you may need to create your own
    filters. This can be a daunting task but ggfx provides a set of helpers for
    removing some of the pain of working with raster objects and figuring out
    the dimensions and location of the drawing area.
  contents:
  - starts_with('viewport_location')
- title: Object support
  desc: >
    ggfx supports a wide range of different object that can be filtered. Most
    are somehow related to ggplot2. The following doc lays out the different
    supported objects.
